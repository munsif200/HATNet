# HATNet: Hierarchical Attention Transformer Network

HATNet is a cutting-edge machine learning framework specifically developed to optimize the synthesis of organic and inorganic materials, including **molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂)**, and to estimate the **photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY)**. By leveraging the power of the **multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism**, HATNet captures complex dependencies within feature spaces, offering a significant advancement over traditional models like XGBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This unified framework is designed for both classification and regression tasks, delivering state-of-the-art performance in material synthesis optimization.

## Key Highlights

- **Unified Framework**: Combines classification and regression tasks using a shared attention-based encoder.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves 95% classification accuracy for MoS₂ synthesis and industry-leading MSE values for CQD PLQY estimation.
- **Automated Feature Learning**: Eliminates manual feature engineering by capturing intricate feature interactions.
- **Broad Applicability**: Designed for energy storage materials, light-emitting devices, light-filtering materials, and beyond.

## Applications

HATNet addresses critical challenges in materials science, with applications in:
- Energy storage systems
- Light-emitting devices
- Advanced material synthesis optimization
- Light-filtering materials
