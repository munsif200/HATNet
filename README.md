# HATNet: Hierarchical Attention Transformer Network

HATNet is a DL framework specifically developed to optimize the synthesis of organic and inorganic materials, including **molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂)**, and to estimate the **photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY)**. By leveraging the power of the **multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism**, HATNet captures complex dependencies within feature spaces, offering a significant advancement over traditional models like XGBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This unified framework, designed for classification and regression tasks, achieved state-of-the-art performance in material synthesis optimization MoS₂ and PLQY.
